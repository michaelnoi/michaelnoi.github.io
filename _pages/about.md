I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), working on 3D computer vision and generative models under the supervision of [David Lindell](https://davidlindell.com/). I graduated with an M.Sc. in Computer Science from [TU Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/).

My M.Sc. thesis was at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) with [Sherwin Bahmani](https://sherwinbahmani.github.io/) and [David Lindell](https://davidlindell.com/). I worked as a research assistant at the [Ommerlab](https://ommer-lab.com/) with [Stephan Baumann](https://stefan-baumann.eu/). My Master's courses included a [project on generalizable novel view synthesis](#projects) with [David Rozenberszki](https://rozdavid.github.io/) and [research on diffusion models in medical imaging](https://cosmin-bercea.com/icml-23) with [Cosmin Bercea](https://cosmin-bercea.com/) and [Julia Schnabel](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/schnabel-julia).

I obtained a B.Sc. in Computer Science and B.A. in Philosophy from the [University of Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/).
