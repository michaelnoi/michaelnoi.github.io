I am a second-year Master's student at the Technical University of Munich. I am interested in 3D computer vision, generative models and fruitfully combining the two. Currently, I am doing a research project supervised by [Chuanxia Zheng](https://chuanxiaz.com/) ([VGG](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) at Oxford). I also work as a research assistant at the [Ommerlab](https://ommer-lab.com/) supervised by [Stephan Baumann](https://stefan-baumann.eu/).

For almost two years now, I am engaged in the educational offerings of [TUM.ai](https://tum-ai.com/) and organize the TUM.ai paper reading circle discussing papers on (3D) computer vision, generative modeling and machine learning in general. Feel free to reach out if you want to join a session.

Previously, I obtained my B.Sc. in Computer Science and B.A. in Philosophy from the University of Munich.
