I am a second-year Master's student at the Technical University of Munich. I am interested in 3D computer vision, generative models and fruitfully combining the two. Currently, I am working as a research assistant at the [Ommerlab](https://ommer-lab.com/) at the [University of Munich (LMU)](https://www.lmu.de/en/).

On the side, I am engaged in the educational offerings of [TUM.ai](https://tum-ai.com/) and organize the TUM.ai paper reading circle. If you are in Munich, interested in (3D) computer vision, generative modeling or machine learning in general and want to join or present in a session, feel free to reach out anytime. Also, I love endurance sports.

Previously, I obtained my B.Sc. in Computer Science and B.A. in Philosophy from the University of Munich.
