I am a final-year Master's student interested in 3D computer vision and generative models. Currently, I am doing my thesis at [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) under the supervision of [David Lindell](https://davidlindell.com/) and [Sherwin Bahmani](https://sherwinbahmani.github.io/), co-supervised by [Matthias Nie√üner](https://www.niessnerlab.org/members/matthias_niessner/profile.html) at TUM. 

Previously, I worked as research assistant at the [Ommerlab](https://ommer-lab.com/) with [Stephan Baumann](https://stefan-baumann.eu/). During my studies, I worked on several projects, including a [course project on generalizable novel view synthesis](/projects/) supervised by [David Rozenberszki](https://rozdavid.github.io/) and a [research project on diffusion models in medical imaging](https://ci.bercea.net/project/autoddpm/) under [Cosmin Bercea](https://cosmin-bercea.com/) and [Julia Schnabel](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/schnabel-julia).

I am engaged in the educational offerings of [TUM.ai](https://tum-ai.com/) for over two years and organize the TUM.ai paper reading circle on (3D) computer vision and generative modeling. I obtained my B.Sc. in Computer Science and B.A. in Philosophy from the University of Munich.
